In March 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43407167) some 10% of the road network maintained by local authorities in Great Britain is in poor condition, or had been flagged for further inspection.

We analysed eight years' of public data from the Department for Transport (DfT), the National Improvement Service for Local Government in Scotland, and six years' of data from Data Unit Walesâ€™ Local Authority Performance. The Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure was unable to provide us with comparable data on the condition of its roads.

Our analysis revealed about 37,000 kilometres (22,990 miles) across England, Wales and Scotland fell below top standard in surveys.
