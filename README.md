In March 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43407167) some 10% of the road network maintained by local authorities in Great Britain is in poor condition, or had been flagged for further inspection.

We analysed eight years' of public data from the Department for Transport (DfT), the National Improvement Service for Local Government in Scotland, and six years' of data from Data Unit Wales’ Local Authority Performance. The Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure was unable to provide us with comparable data on the condition of its roads.

Our analysis revealed about 37,000 kilometres (22,990 miles) across England, Wales and Scotland fell below top standard in surveys.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
